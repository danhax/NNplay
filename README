FifthTry.py  :  With MonPwr logic, polynomials after convolution, then relu
                As saved, with mnum = 2, and constant disallowed,
                the polynomials are equal to the convolutions

SixthTry.py :  MonPwr removed, just convolutions not polynomials thereof

SeventhTry : with softmax summed over pixels works with smaller clen

EighthTry : With multiple sizes using fft pool
